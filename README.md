# Cypress

[Replay](https://replay.io) enabled fork of the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) library.

## Overview

This is an alternative to Cypress that runs tests in the same way as the upstream Cypress library, and adds support for recording tests using replay enabled browsers.  By default, recordings will only be created for failing tests when using `cypress run`.

## Install

Please check the [Cypress system requirements](https://on.cypress.io/installing-cypress).  Additionally, using replay enabled browsers is currently only supported on macOS and linux.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @recordreplay/cypress
```

## Documentation
